%section
	%h1 (Framework) Agnostic packages
	%ol
		%li.fragment Packages that do not believe in one single framework.
		%li.fragment Most packages are. Or not. I don't have any stats, really.
		%li.fragment Multiple ways to achieve agnosticism (patterns)

%section
	%p More importantly<br>Agnostic is most of the cases the <strong>right way</strong> to do packages

%section
	%h1 Benefits
	%img{:src => 'images/benefits.png'}

%section
	%h1 The obvious ones
	%ol
		%li.fragment
			%p Wider audience:
			%span.fragment Carebears
			%span.fragment , Schrodingers
			%span.fragment , The Rest
		%li.fragment Not locked to a framework's release cycle
		%li.fragment "wow much package very agnostic"

%section
	%h1 The totally-not-obvious-but-still-kind-of-nice ones
	%ol
		%li.fragment Intrinsinc respect of the SRP principles
		%li.fragment Better understanding of how the various frameworks work
		%li.fragment Use whatever package you want as foundation
		%li.fragment
			Being a strong independent tax-paying citizen
			%img{src: 'images/independence.jpg'}

%section
	%h1	Pitfalls
	%img{src: 'images/pitfalls.jpg'}

%section
	%h2 Pitfalls
	%ol
		%li.fragment Thinking it's going to be easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy
		%li.fragment <strike>You do not talk about Figh</strike> You have no idea what the destination environment is
		%li.fragment Thinking too much in terms of "framework" features
		%li.fragment
			Dependencies conflicts. All the time.
			%span.fragment ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

%section
	%h1 Cool story bro
	%h2 but how?

%section
	%h1 Requirements
	%ol
		%li
			%span Namespaces
			%span.fragment Symfony\Foundation\How\The\Fuck\Do\People\Even\Remember\All\That
		%li.fragment PSR all the things.
		%li.fragment
			%span Loosely-couple your dependencies<br>
			%code.fragment "illuminate/support": "4.2.0"<br>
			%code.fragment "illuminate/support": "4.2.*|5.0.*"

%section
	%h2 Writing agnostic packages is no different than writing front-end features
	%h3.fragment Graceful degradation
	%h3.fragment Progressive enhancement

%section
	%h1 Graceful degradation
	%p.fragment When an escalator breaks, it's still stairs
	%p.fragment Is when you'd rely on a set of features from the framework, and do your best so your package is usable if the freamwork doesn't have them

%section
	%h2 Example: migrations
	%code.fragment whatevertisan migrate your/package
	%pre.fragment
		%code
			$migrator = new Vendor\Package\Migrator($pdo);
			$migrator->migrate();

%section
	%h2 Progressive enhancement
	%p.fragment Adding an elevator next to a set of stairs
	%p.fragment Building something that works for the ground up, and adding adaptators for the various frameworks

%section
	%h2 Example: service providers
	%p.fragment Make your package work as is by just creating an instance, then add service providers that hooks those services into the framework
	%pre.fragment
		%code
			:plain
				class MyPackageServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
				{
					public function register()
					{
						$this->package('vendor/package');

						$this->app->singleton('command', 'Vendor\Package\MyCommand');
						$this->commands('command');
					}
				}

%section
	%div.fragment
		%h2 Those can be in the same repository
		%img{:src => 'images/providers.png'}
	%div.fragment
		%h2 Or decicated repositories
		%img{:src => 'images/repositories.png'}
